# **Text Data Cleaning and Offensive Comment Detection with a built Transformer from Scratch**

In this NLP project, I've undertaken the challenging task of cleaning and analyzing text data to build a custom transformer model for identifying offensive comments. This comprehensive effort not only involved data preprocessing and analysis but also the creation of a specialized model from scratch.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Text Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Rigorous data cleaning and analysis processes to ensure the quality and reliability of the text data.
- **Custom Transformer Model:** Development of a unique transformer model tailored for the task of identifying offensive comments, showcasing expertise in natural language processing.
- **Model Training and Optimization:** Rigorous model training, fine-tuning, and optimization to achieve a remarkable accuracy score of 96%.

**What to Expect:**
- A detailed exploration of offensive comment detection in the context of natural language processing.
- An in-depth understanding of the inner workings of transformer models.
- An optimized model with an impressive 96% accuracy for real-world applications.

This project not only highlights the capabilities of cutting-edge NLP techniques but also offers practical insights into addressing online content moderation and maintaining healthy online communities. Whether you're in the field of NLP, content moderation, or machine learning, this project is a valuable resource for understanding and implementing custom transformer models.
